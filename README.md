# Scripts to solve Initital Value Problems Using Numerical Analysis

**Note: Each script contains an example IVP to solve for but the scripts can be edited to solve other IVPs**

euler.py : Uses Euler's Method to approximate y(1) of a function

midpointEuler.py : Uses Midpoint Euler's Method to approximate y(1) of a function

rungeKuttaMEthod4.py : Uses Runge Kutta MEthod of order 4 to approximate y(1) of a function

simpsons.py : Uses the composite Simpson rule to approximate the soltion to an interval (contains example in script)
